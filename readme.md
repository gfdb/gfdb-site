# gfdb.dev

This is my personal website. Naturally, I plan to use it to display my work experience and skills. Beyond that though, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it yet. I'd like it to just be a cool place where I can build things and put them on display for people like you to see and interact with. 

# Tech Stack
### frontend
- ReactJS 
### backend
- NodeJS
### physics for nav game
- MatterJS

# Goals for this project
- Learn more about React and javascript in general.
- Build a unique website, not some boring resume website that you've seen 1000 times.
- Learn a bit about UI design.
- Learn a bit about game design.
- It wasn't a goal at the beginning but I ended up brushing up on my physics lol
- Learn to deploy a javascript project to production
- More to come as I go

This is my first time using React. It's also my first time having an independant frontend server... pretty crazy stuff. Especially ```useEffect()```. 


I'll will write more about  the site in this readme when there is more to show.
